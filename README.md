## What is Cypress

**Cypress** is an end-to-end testing framework for web applications. With Cypress, you can write tests in JavaScript to simulate user interactions like clicking buttons and filling forms. It runs directly in the browser alongside your app, providing real-time feedback.

**Cypress** offers features like automatic waiting, time-travel debugging, and network traffic control. It's a popular tool for ensuring web app quality and reliability.

## Why you need to learn Cypress

Because ~~your manager said so~~ it saves ton of time when test, when you write automated tests for your app, you will be able to check if they still work as intended in couple of minutes instead of testing again from zero, and you can automate some of your repeated tasks of you are nerd enough,

## Before you start:

In order to start using it, you have to have some solid background in JS basics (at the very least),
concepts you should know:

- Start with fundamental concepts like variables, data types, loops, and conditional statements.etc
- Learn about functions, objects, and arrays in JavaScript.
- Understand asynchronous programming concepts like callbacks, promises, and async/await.
- Familiarize yourself with basic HTML tags and structure.
- Learn CSS for styling web elements
...

I recommend checking this course on [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/learn/courses/le-javascript), then study [promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) and [async](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) on you own

Or you can choose to take the track on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/concepts)

### installation:

Make sure you have:

- Node
- VSCode (or any code editor you like)

The reset in the session, see you there.
